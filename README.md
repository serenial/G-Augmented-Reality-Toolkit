G Augmented-Reality Toolkit is Webcam based Augmented-Reality Toolkit built with LabVIEW 2020.

This toolkit is a complete solution for building Augmented Reality functionality with LabVIEW encompassing image capture, processing and AR marker detection with 3D rendering using LabVIEW’s native 3D picture.

This toolkit could also be for you if you are looking for any of the following
* A system-native open-source webcam/capture-card driver for LabVIEW

* Integration of OpenCV routines for basic image manipulation

* Access to OpenCV camera calibration and image rectification

* Utilities for fitting 3D points to planes and combining 3D point-maps

This toolkit is released with ❤️ with the LabVIEW code under the permissive BSD Zero Clause Licence and the dynamically linked binary code is released under the LGPL-2.1.

Users of this toolkit in any larger software must ensure that the dependencies of this toolkit are appropriately acknowledged.

## Getting the Toolkit
The toolkit can be downloaded as a VIPM package or as a zipped release for usage directly from the releases tab

Pre-built binaries are provided for Windows (Intel/AMD x86 and x64), Linux and NI Linux Real-Time (Intel/AMD x64). No support for Mac is planned as yet.
